# Project 1

## Product Vision

FOR hosts and event attenders WHO need an event guestlist manager THE Event RSVP Maker is a web-based application THAT provides event management capability. UNLIKE other event management services, OUR product highlights bi-directional communication between the event hosts and guests in the form of guest notes. 



# RSVP Maker - Proof of Concept

## Description
This is a basic prototype for an RSVP Maker app. It shows how a user might RSVP to an event and includes mock data to represent a list of attendees.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Fill in the name, email, and number of guests.
3. Click "Submit RSVP" â€” a pop-up will confirm your submission.
4. A sample RSVP list is shown below the form.

## Notes
- This is a **proof-of-concept**, meaning it does not save data or connect to a backend yet.
- Alerts are used in place of full functionality.
